Communication
=============

A guide for communicating within The MTM Agency.

Tools we use for communication:
-------------------------------

* [G Suite] (previously known as Google for Business)
* [Skype](https://www.skype.com/en/download-skype/skype-for-computer/)
* [Slack](https://slack.com/downloads/osx)
* [ActiveCollab](https://activecollab.com/)

[G Suite]: https://gsuite.google.com/

G Suite
-------

* Login on the regular [Gmail](https://mail.google.com) page using your MTM email login details.

Slack
-----

* Use [Slack](htts://slack.com) to share agency and project based thinking, info and documentation.
* Don't create a new Slack channel just because you can. Consult the team and decide if a new channel is necessary.

ActiveCollab (AC)
-----------------

* Don't create a new Project for every single job that comes into the stack. Consult the team and decide if a new Project is necessary.
* People should assign themselves to AC cards. When in doubt, do not assign a ticket to someone, instead post a message on Slack in project channel with a link to the AC card and relevant team member should be able to assign the card to him/her self.
