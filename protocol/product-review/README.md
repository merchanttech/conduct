Product Review
==============

Cut down cycle time and focus on the user
by getting a teammate to review your changes to the product
before you get a code review or deploy to staging.

For each change, choose one of the following techniques:

* In-person
* Screencast
* Video chat and screen-share

In-person
---------

have them review the changes in person.
