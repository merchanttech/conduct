# ![Conduct](./conduct-cover.png)

**Conduct** is a set of guides for getting things done, programming well, and programming in style within The MTM Agency.

## High level guidelines:

- Be consistent.
- Don't rewrite existing code to follow this guide.
- Don't violate a guideline without a good reason.
- A reason is good when you can convince a teammate.

## A note on the language:

- "**Avoid**" means don't do it unless you have good reason.
- "**Don't**" means there's never a good reason.
- "**Prefer**" indicates a better option and it's alternative to watch out for.
- "**Use**" is a positive instruction.
