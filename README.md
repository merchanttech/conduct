High level guidelines:

* Don't violate a guideline without a good reason.
* A reason is good when you can convince a teammate.

A note on the language:

* "**Avoid**" means don't do it unless you have good reason.
* "**Don't**" means there's never a good reason.
* "**Prefer**" indicates a better option and it's alternative to watch out for.
* "**Use**" is a positive instruction.
