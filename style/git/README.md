Git
===

* Use hyphenated style when naming branches: `branch-name`, not `branch_name` or `branchName`.
* Avoid merge conflicts by using a [rebase workflow].
* Squash multiple trivial commits into a single commit.
* Write a [good commit message]:
  * Capitalize your commit messages.
  * Start your message with a verb.
  * Use present tense.
  * If case, refer to the issue/PR number in your squashed commit message.
