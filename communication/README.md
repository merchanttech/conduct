## G Suite

- Login on the regular [Gmail](https://mail.google.com) page using your MTM email login details.

### Stories

- People should not be assigned to stories.

### Tickets

- People assign themselves to tickets (tasks or bugs). When in doubt, do not
  assign a ticket to someone.

## Microsoft Teams

- Use Microsoft Teams to share agency and project based thinking, info and documentation.
- Don't create a new channel just because you can. Consult the team and decide if a new channel is necessary.

## ActiveCollab (AC)

- Don't create a new Project for every single job that comes into the stack. Consult the team and decide if a new Project is necessary.
